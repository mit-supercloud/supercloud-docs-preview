The Systems and Software page contains information about what is available on the system. In the Using the System tab, you will find information about how to set up your environment, including gaining access to software and packages you need, how to transfer files between your machine and the system, how to submit, monitor, and stop jobs, and how to use Jupyter and the web portal. Getting Help describes how to best ask for help, if you cannot find the answer to your question on this page or on our Frequently Asked Questions page. Finally, we include a Glossary of words that we use in this wiki and what we mean when we say them.</p> <p>Note that Supercloud has Monthly Downtimes which are scheduled for the Second Tuesday of each month. During downtimes the system is not available. Downtimes usually last about a day and emails are sent when they are complete. We also send out a reminder email a few days before each downtime.

We have set quotas on this directory to prevent a single person from inadvertently filling it up, as when this happens it can cause issues for everyone using the node, including preventing anyone from installing packages. This can be fixed by setting the <code>TMPIDR</code> environment variable like so:</p> <pre><code>mkdir /state/partition1/user/$USER\nexport TMPDIR=/state/partition1/user/$USER\n</code></pre> <p>After you have installed your package you can clean up any lingering files by removing the temporary directory you have created:</p> <p><code>rm -rf /state/partition1/user/$USER</code></p>"},{"location":"faqs/#how-can-i-set-up-vscode-to-edit-files-remotely-on-supercloud","title":"How can I set up VSCode to edit files remotely on Supercloud?","text":"<p>You can use VSCode to remotely connect to Supercloud via the Remote-SSH extension. The default settings in the VSCode Remote - SSH extension will fail to connect. This is due to it trying to lock files in your home directory, which is disabled for performance reasons.</p> <p>The solution is to have it use the local filesystem. To get it to work, go to your VS Code settings, click \"Extensions\" and then \"Remote - SSH\". Once you're in the settings for Remote - SSH, check the box next to \"Remote.SSH: Lockfiles in Tmp\". What this will do is put any lockfiles in /tmp, rather than your home directory.</p> <p>A side note: we have seen VS Code clutter up /tmp in the past, which we keep fairly small. Disconnecting occasionally should clean these up, however we do not know for sure.

Oversubscribing can overwhelm the node, which can slow your job down or even cause it to fail. It can also be harmful for the node. Reduce the number of threads per process or number of processes per node so that the total number of threads is less than or equal to the number of cores.</p> <p>Underutilizing: When you have fewer threads than the number of cores on the node you may be undersubscribing. This means you may not be taking full advantage of the node. Many underlying packages and libraries can take advantage of multithreading.

That doesn't mean you have to be a Linux expert to use the system! However the more you can get comfortable with the Linux command line and a handful of basic commands, the easier using the system will be. If you are already familiar with Linux, feel free to skip this section, or skim as a refresher.</p> <p>Most Linux commands deal with directories and files. A directory, synonymous to a folder, contains files and other directories. The list of directories that lead to a particular directory or file is called its path. In Linux, directories on a path are separated by forward slashes <code>/</code>. It is also important to note that everything in Linux is case sensitive, so a file <code>myScript.sh</code> is not the same as the file <code>myscript.sh</code>. When you first log in you are in you home directory. Your home directory is where you can put all the code and data you need to run your job. Your home directory is not accessible to other users, if you need a space to share files with other users, let us know and we can make a shared group directory for you. The path to your home directory on SuperCloud is <code>/home/gridsan/[USERNAME]</code>, where <code>[USERNAME]</code> is your username. The character <code>~</code> is also shorthand for your home directory in any Linux commands.</p> <p>Anytime after you start typing a Linux command you can press the \"Tab\" button your your keyboard. This called tab-complete, and will try to autocomplete what you are typing. This is particularly helpful when typing out long directory paths and file names. Pressing \"Tab\" once will complete if there is a single completion, pressing it twice will list all potential completions. It is a bit difficult to explain in text, but you can try it out yourself and watch the short demonstration here.</p> <p>Finally, below is a list of Linux Commands. Try them out for yourself at the command line.</p> <ul> <li>Creating, navigating and viewing directories:<ul> <li><code>pwd</code>: tells you the full path of the directory you are     currently in</li> <li><code>mkdir dirname</code>: creates a directory with the name \"dirname\"</li> <li><code>cd dirname</code>: change directory to directory \"dirname\"<ul> <li><code>cd ../</code>: takes you up one level</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>ls</code>: lists the files in the directory<ul> <li><code>ls -a</code>: lists all files including hidden files</li> <li><code>ls -l</code>: lists files in \"long format\" including ownership     and date of last update</li> <li><code>ls -t</code>: lists files by date stamp, most recently updated     file first</li> <li><code>ls -tr</code>: lists files by dates stamp in reverse order, most     recently updated file is listed last (this is useful if you     have a lot of files, you want to know which file you changed     last and the list of files results in a scrolling window)</li> <li><code>ls dirname</code>: lists the files in the directory \"dirname\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Viewing files<ul> <li><code>more filename</code>: shows the first part of a file, hitting the     space bar allows you to scroll through the rest of the file, q     will cause you to exit out of the file.</li> <li><code>less filename</code>: allows you to scroll through the file, forward     and backward, using the arrow keys.</li> <li><code>tail filename</code>: shows the last 10 lines of a file (useful when     you are monitoring a logfile or output file to see that the     values are correct)<ul> <li>t<code>ail &lt;number&gt; filename</code>: show you the last &lt;number&gt;     lines of a file.</li> <li><code>tail -f filename</code>: shows you new lines as they are written     to the end of the file.

In our tutorial we go over much more on how to submit jobs and will make sure you have the tools you need to get the most out of the MIT SuperCloud.</p>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"getting-started/#supercloud-downtimes","title":"SuperCloud Downtimes","text":"<p>Note that SuperCloud has Monthly Downtimes which are scheduled for the Second Tuesday of each month. During downtimes the system is not available. Downtimes usually last about a day and emails are sent when they are complete. We also send out a reminder email a few days before each downtime.</p>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"glossary/","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>The following is a list of commonly used terms and acronyms, and their definitions when used in the context of the MIT SuperCloud.</p> <p>First is a visual labeling the portions of the system with the terminology we tend to use for each piece.</p> <p></p> <p>Accelerators A piece of hardware used to speed up computation, usually for a   specific operation. GPUs are used as an accelerator for certain matrix   operations.</p> <p>Bandwidth A theoretical measure of how much data could be transferred from   source to destination in a given amount of time.</p> <p>Bash shell A specific shell and language used at the command line. This is the   shell used on SuperCloud.</p> <p>Bash script/Shell script A script using bash command syntax.</p> <p>Batch job A job for running a pre-written script or executable. Resources are   requested through the scheduler, the schedule allocates the resources   when they are available, runs the script, and then exits.</p> <p>Cluster Many nodes connected via a fast network interconnect.</p> <p>Command Line A text-based user interface that allows a user to type commands that   the computer then executes.</p> <p>Compute Nodes Nodes where the computation is done on the system (where you will run   your code). Compute nodes are managed by the scheduler.</p> <p>Core A core is the smallest computation unit that can run a program.</p> <p>CPU The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of a computer which   executes software programs. CPU refers to an individual silicon chip,   such as Intel's Xeon-E5 or AMD's Opteron. \u00a0A CPU contains one or   more cores. \u00a0Also known as a processor or socket.</p> <p>Data Server Also called an Object Storage Server. A component of a parallel file   system which stores all of the data of the files on the file system.</p> <p>(Job) Dependency Defer the start of a job until the specified dependencies have been   satisfied completed. This is usually the completion of another job.</p> <p>Distributed Memory (see \"Memory Models\") In\u00a0a distributed memory system, each CPU has its own private memory.   Processes can only operate on local data. If remote data is required,   the process must communicate with the remote process over an   interconnect.</p> <p>Downtime A regular maintenance day during which the system is unavailable.</p> <p>Environment Variable Environment variables allow you to customize the environment in which   programs run. They become part of the environment in which the   programs run and can be queried by running programs. For example, you   can set an environment variable to contain the path to your data   files. Your running process can query this environment variable to get   the location of the files.</p> <p>File Permissions Properties of a file that determine who can read, write, or execute   (run) a file.</p> <p>Filesystem The system that controls how and where data is stored on storage disk.   See Shared/Central Filesystem and Local Filesystem.</p> <p>GPU A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized device originally   used to generate computer output. \u00a0Each compute node can host one or   more GPUs. \u00a0Modern GPUs have many simple compute cores and have been   used for parallel processing.</p> <p>Group Shared Directory A directory, created upon user request, where members of the group   shared directory can share files with other members of the group.   \u00a0Since a user's home directory is accessible only to the user, a group   shared directory is the only mechanism for users to share files.</p> <p>GUI Graphical User Interface- these are interfaces that allow the user to   interact with a program with a mouse through visual icons, as opposed   to a command line interface.</p> <p>Home Directory Where the user keeps their files. Each user has their own home   directory.</p> <p>HPC High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of aggregating   computing power to achieve higher performance that would not possible   by using a typical computer.\u00a0 The community often used\u00a0concurrent   computing\u00a0to mean programs running at the same time v in serial one   after another.</p> <p>Hub A networking component that takes an incoming message and broadcasts   it across all of the other ports of the hub.</p> <p>Independent (Tasks/Processes) Tasks/processes that can operate by themselves without needing data   from another.</p> <p>Interactive Job An interactive job allows you to actually log in to a compute node.   This is useful for when you need to compile software, test jobs and   scripts, or run software that requires keyboard inputs and user   interaction, such as a graphical interface\u00a0.</p> <p>Interconnects The connections between components of the computer (this interconnect   is called the System Network), and the computer to the Internet   network (this interconnect is called the Network Connection).</p> <p>I/O (Input/Output) Refers operations that involve a transfer of data, particularly   reading from and writing to the filesystem.</p> <p>Job A job is a separately executable unit of work whose resources are   allocated and shared. \u00a0Users create job submission scripts to ask the   scheduler for resources (cores, a specific processor type, etc). \u00a0The   scheduler places the requests in a queue and allocates the requested   resources.</p> <p>Job Array According to the Slurm documentation: \u00a0\"Job arrays offer a mechanism   for submitting and managing collections of similar jobs quickly and   easily\". \u00a0 Job arrays are useful for applying the same processing   routine to a collection of multiple inputs, data, or files. \u00a0Job   arrays offer a very simple way to submit a large number of independent   or\u00a0High Throughput\u00a0processing jobs.</p> <p>Job Slot A computational resource unit that is roughly equivalent to a   processor core. One or more job slots can be used to execute a   process.</p> <p>Jupyter Notebook An interactive browser-based programming environment.</p> <p>Latency The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction   for its transfer.</p> <p>Lgpn Average observed Load per GPU on the node.</p> <p>LLGrid Beta LLGrid Beta is a collection of software packages that are released as   a beta test on the SuperCloud. \u00a0The beta software packages are ones   that SuperCloud users have requested but are not included in the   SuperCloud system image.</p> <p>LLMapReduce A language-agnostic command for running loosely coupled or MapReduce   applications.</p> <p>LLx A course platform containing online courses that use the SuperCloud   system for exercises.</p> <p>Lnode Average observed Load on the node.</p> <p>Local Filesystem Each node in the cluster has its own local filesystem that is only   accessible from that node. The system image and software stack is on   the local filesystem. It also contains space that can be used during   jobs for fast file access.</p> <p>Login Node The login node controls user access to a parallel computer. \u00a0Users   usually connect to login nodes via SSH to compile and debug their   code, review their results, do some simple tests, and submit their   interactive and batch jobs to the scheduler.</p> <p>Loosely Coupled Applications that involve an independent (map) step where the same   operation can be performed by many processes on different inputs,   followed by a serial step that uses the output of the first step as   its input. Also called MapReduce.</p> <p>Lppn Average observed Load per process on the node.</p> <p>Man page Short for \"manual page\". Documentation for a command or program.</p> <p>MapReduce See \"Loosely Coupled\".</p> <p>Mbpc Memory Bytes Per Core.</p> <p>Mbpn Memory Bytes Per Node.</p> <p>Mbpp Memory Bytes Per Process.</p> <p>Memory See \"Volatile Memory\".</p> <p>Memory Models (see \"Distributed Memory\" and \"Shared Memory\")</p> <p></p> <p>Metadata Server A component of a parallel file system which maintains the state of all   files and folders within the file system, and the list of data servers   where it can find the data for the files.</p> <p>MIMO Mode Multiple input, multiple output is an application mode for use with   LLMapReduce. In MIMO mode your application iterates through multiple   inputs. LLMapReduce calls and loads your application once in order to   process multiple assigned inputs.</p> <p>Modules Here we are referring to \"environment modules\", but we often refer   to them just as \"modules\". An open source software management tool   used in most HPC facilities. \u00a0Using modules enable users to   selectively pick the software that they want and add them to their   environment. \u00a0Using the module command, you can manipulate your   environment to gain access to new software or different versions of a   package.</p> <p>MPI The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library for passing messages   between processes and between compute nodes within a parallel job   running on a cluster. There are a variety of open source and   commercial versions of MPI that have\u00a0been developed over the past   several decades including mpich,\u00a0 OpenMPI, and Intel MPI.</p> <p>Multi-Threaded Describes an application that uses multiple threads. See \"Shared   Memory\".\u00a0</p> <p>Ncpn Number of hardware Cores Per Node.</p> <p>Ngpn Number of hardware GPUs Per Node.</p> <p>Nnode Number of Nodes.</p> <p>Node A stand-alone computer where jobs are run. \u00a0Each node is connected to   other compute nodes via a fast network interconnect. \u00a0While accessible   via interactive jobs, compute nodes are not meant to be accessed   directly by users.</p> <p>Non-Volatile Memory Storage device where the information stored on it remains intact even   when the computer is shut down or restarted, e.g., disk drives.</p> <p>Np Number of Processes = Nnode * Nppn.</p> <p>Nppn Number of Processes Per Node.</p> <p>Ntpn Number of Threads Per Node = Nppn * Ntpp.</p> <p>Ntpp Number of Threads Per Process.</p> <p>Operating System (OS) The software that manages how each of the applications running on the   computer interact with the hardware of the computer to accomplish   tasks.</p> <p>Path A list of directories separated by \"/\" characters that shows the   location of a file or directory in the directory structure.</p> <p>Absolute Path The full path from the root of the filesystem, /. For example, the   absolute path to the home directory for studentx would be:   /home/gridsan/studentx.</p> <p>Relative\u00a0Path The path to a file or directory from the current location.</p> <p>Process An independent computation running on a computer. \u00a0Processes have   their own address space and may create threads that will share their   address space. \u00a0Processes must use interprocess communication to   communicate with other processes.</p> <p>Router A networking component that acts as a special switch that moves   messages across defined network boundaries.</p> <p>Rsync A command for transferring and syncing files between systems.</p> <p>Scheduler The scheduler receives job and task execution requests from users and   manages how and where they are executed across the many compute nodes   in the HPC system. Before starting a job, it ensures that the needed   resources are available for the job. The scheduler monitors running   jobs, can stop jobs, and can provide information about completed jobs   and the status of the system (e.g. what resources are currently   available).</p> <p>Shared/Central Filesystem The shared filesystem is the filesystem that is available to all nodes   in the cluster. Home and group directories are on the shared   filesystem.</p> <p>Shared Memory\u00a0(see \"Memory Models\") In\u00a0a shared memory system, there is shared memory that can be   simultaneously accessed by multiple CPUs in a multiprocessor CPU.   Communication or data passing among threads or processes in a shared   memory system is via memory.</p> <p>Shell Another term for the Linux command line interface.</p> <p>SISO Mode Single input, single output is an application mode for use   with\u00a0LLMapReduce. In SISO mode, your application runs on a single   input. LLMapReduce calls and loads your application once in order to   process one assigned input.</p> <p>Slurm Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is a job   scheduler which coordinates the running of many programs on a shared   facility. \u00a0Slurm is used on the MIT SuperCloud system. \u00a0It replaced   the SGE scheduler.</p> <p>Socket A computational unit packaged as one, and usually made of a single   chip often called processor. \u00a0Modern sockets carry many cores.</p> <p>SPMD Single Program Multiple Data</p> <p>SSH Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol to securely access remote computers.   \u00a0Based on the client-server model, users with an SSH client can access   a remote computer. \u00a0Some operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS   have a built-in SSH client and others can use one of many publicly   available clients. \u00a0For Windows, we recommend PuTTY or Cygwin for ssh.</p> <p>SSH Keys Credentials used as an authentication method for ssh. These come in   pairs: a public and private key. Public keys are placed on the system   you need to access, private keys are placed on your computer. When you   ssh in the ssh program checks to see whether the public key fits your   private key.</p> <p>Submission/batch script A script for submitting a batch job to the scheduler. It is a bash   script that tells the scheduler how to run your job, and may include   the resources you are requesting for you job.</p> <p>Switch A networking component that is more efficient than a hub. It takes an   incoming network message and sends it out only onto the switch port on   which its destination will be reached. Switches only transmit messages   within a defined network.</p> <p>Symlink Short for symbolic link. A file that acts as a shortcut by pointing to   another file or directory on the filesystem. If you are in a group you   may see a symbolic link to the shared group directory in your home   directory.</p> <p>Terminal (Window) A window containing a command line prompt.</p> <p>Third-party software According to Wikipedia: a third-party software component is a reusable   software component developed to be either freely distributed or sold   by an entity other than the original vendor of the development   platform.\u00a0</p> <p>Examples of third-party software on the SuperCloud system include MATLAB and TensorFlow.\u00a0</p> <p>Thread Threads are lightweight processes which exist within a single   operating system process. \u00a0Threads share the address space of the   process that created them and can communicate directly with other   threads in the same process.</p> <p>Throughput An actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from   source to destination in a given amount of time.</p> <p>Throughput (Workflow) A throughput application is one that is fully independent. Often this   means it is running the same operation on a number of different inputs   or parameters, and the result of an operation on one input does not   depend on the result of another.</p> <p>Triples (Mode) A job submission mode that allows you to request resources in a   triple: Number of Nodes, Number of Processes per Node, and Number of   Threads per Process. Available for LLsub job arrays, LLMapReduce, and   pMatlab jobs.</p> <p>Ubpn Average observed Used bytes per node.</p> <p>Ubpp Average observed Used bytes per process.</p> <p>Unix, Linux Unix is a family of portable, multi-tasking, multi-user operating   systems. Linux is an open source, Unix-like operating system that is   derived from Unix. The SuperCloud system runs the Ubuntu version of   the Linux operating system.</p> <p>User space User space is a set of locations where normal user processes (i.e.   everything other than the kernel, the lowest part of the operating   system) run.</p> <p>Volatile Memory Storage device where applications and data are loaded so that the   processors can actively work with them, e.g. RAM and cache. The   information stored on it does not remain intact when the computer is   shut down or restarted.</p> <p>Web Portal A web page for SuperCloud where you can access your SuperCloud   account. On the Web Portal you can add ssh keys, access the files in   your home directory, and start Jupyter Notebooks.</p>"},{"location":"online-courses/","title":"Online Courses","text":""},{"location":"online-courses/#some-available-online-courses","title":"Some Available Online Courses","text":"<p>Practical HPC: An introductory course that:</p> <ul> <li>Includes an introduction to HPC, canonical HPC Workflows, and the     SuperCloud system.</li> <li>Walks you through setting up your account, installing software,     running your first test job, submitting your first batch job.</li> <li>Describes how to scale up efficiently and measure your performance.</li> </ul> <p>Mathematics of Big Data and Machine Learning: Available through OCW.</p>"},{"location":"online-courses/#accessing-the-llx-online-course-site","title":"Accessing the LLx Online Course Site","text":"<p>Navigate to LLx and follow the instructions below to create an account, or click \"Sign In\" if you have an account.

This workflow is representative of \"loosely coupled\" processing, where the coupling comes from gathering the result files and is often handled using the MapReduce paradigm.</p> <p>To ease the burden on researchers and to provide good performance for the MapReduce Use Case on a community shared production machine, the SuperCloud Team created LLMapReduce.</p>","tags":["Submitting Jobs","LLMapReduce"]},{"location":"new-pages/llmapreduce/#the-llmapreduce-command","title":"The LLMapReduce Command","text":"<p>The options included in the LLMapReduce API provide extensive flexibility. At its most basic, LLMapReduce executes a user script on all the files in a user supplied input directory. The results are saved to unique files in the output directory. If the user requires a 2nd phase to post-process the data, the user provided reducer script performs the gather task followed by the post-processing.</p> <p>LLMapReduce is language agnostic, and we provide examples for MATLAB\u00ae, Java and Python. LLMapReduce supports nested LLMapReduce calls and we provide an example of this along with the other examples.</p> <p>The LLMapReduce command scans the user-specified input directory and translates each individual file into a computing task for the user-specified application (noted as Mapper in the image below). Then, all of the computing tasks will be submitted to the SuperCloud systems for processing. If needed, the results can be post-processed by setting up a user-specified reduce task, which is dependent on the mapping task results.

First, say you need to train 160 models. You would normally have to wait for the first 16 GPUs to be available, and then as those complete, you'd have to wait for the next 16 to be available, etc., 10 times until you've trained all your models. LLMapReduce will allocate the 16 GPUs to you, train your first 16, and then train your next 16 within that same allocation. You've reduced the time your jobs are waiting to run by quite a bit, especially when the system is quite busy. This you get for free with LLMapReduce, you usually don't have to make any changes to your code at all, or some very minor changes.</p> <p>Another way that LLMapReduce can reduce startup cost is by using mimo (multiple input multiple output) mode, which we highly recommend. You make a few changes to your code so that instead of training a single model during each run, it will iterate through and train several (it would train 10 models in sequence from the example above) models during each run. In this case you only have to pay the startup cost of your code once. Depending on how much time this takes, you can really save a lot of time here.

A single process calls your application multiple times to process all of the input files that are assigned to it. This is referred to as the single input, single output (siso) model.</p> <p>In the multiple input, multiple output (mimo) model, multiple temporary files named <code>input_&lt;#&gt;</code> are automatically generated and written into your temporary MAPRED directory. Each of these files contains a list of filename pairs: an input data filename and its corresponding output filename. Each of the launched processes will be given, as an argument, the name of one of the <code>input_&lt;#&gt;</code> files. The number of these <code>input_&lt;#&gt;</code> is determined by the value of the <code>--np</code> or <code>--ndata</code> parameter that is used. See the Resource Limit Enforcement page for the default values for <code>--np</code> based on the cpu type.</p> <p>The advantage of using the mimo model is that your application is called and loaded just once to process all of its assigned input files. For example, if you are running MATLAB\u00ae code, the overhead of starting and stopping MATLAB\u00ae for each input file can become significant if you are processing a lot of data files.</p> <p>The <code>--apptype=mimo</code> option allows you to run your application in mimo mode, to eliminate the unnecessary overhead of repeated starts and stops of the application. The only caveat is that your application has to be modified slightly to be able to read a file and process the multiple lines of input output filename pairs in that file.</p> <p>This change is easy to implement in high level programming languages such as MATLAB\u00ae and Python.</p> <p>In your <code>~/examples/LLGrid_MapReduce/Java</code> directory, there is an example of an <code>LLMapReduce</code> job which uses the <code>--apptype=mimo</code> option.

You can check if conda has a library with the command: <code>conda\u00a0search\u00a0r-LIBNAME</code>, where <code>LIBNAME</code> is the name of the library you're looking for.

Triples mode provides a few advantages. Since it does whole-node scheduling you don't have to worry about other jobs impacting yours (or your job impacting someone else's). We also do task-pinning when you request resources with a triple, so your processes are arranged in the best way possible for the layout of the hardware architecture. Finally, submitting a Job Array with LLsub triples mode the way we describe here will greatly reduce the startup time for your jobs, over a job array with many pending tasks.</p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/submitting-jobs/job-array-triples/#step-1-batch-up-your-array","title":"Step 1: Batch Up your Array","text":"<p>The first thing you want to do is set up your job so that your script splits up your inputs among each process/task and each process/task iterates a subset of your inputs. This way you can change your input set without changing the number of tasks or processes that you schedule. This step alone will save you on startup time. Anytime you submit more jobs than your allocation allows, those additional jobs will remaining pending until some of your first running jobs complete. Then, when one of your first jobs complete, the scheduler now has to find the pending job some resources and start it running. If you batch up your job array, you only have to go through the scheduling process once. If you've set up a job array following our instructions in the past you may already be doing this, and you can skip to the next section.</p> <p>First you want to take a look at your code. Code that can be submitted as a Job Array usually has one big for loop. If you are iterating over multiple parameters or files, and have nested for loops, you'll first want to enumerate all the combinations of what you are iterating over so you have one big loop.</p> <p>If your code is written so it uses the <code>$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</code> and uses that to run a single thing, first add a for loop that iterates over the full set of things you want to run your code on.

See the page LLsub Job Array Triples to see how to set this up.</p> <p>A simple way to run the same script or command with different parameters or on different files in parallel is by using a Job Array. With a Job Array, the parallelism happens at the Scheduler level and is completely language agnostic. The best way to use a Job Array is to batch up your parameters so you have a finite number of tasks each running a set of parameters, rather than one task for each parameter. In your submission script you specify numeric indices, corresponding to the number of tasks that you want running at once. Those indices, or Task IDs are captured in environment variables, along with the total number of tasks, and passed into your script. Your script then has the information it needs to split up the work among tasks. This process is described in the Teaching Examples github repository, with examples in Julia and Python.</p> <p>First you want to take a look at your code. Code that can be submitted as a Job Array usually has one big for loop. If you are iterating over multiple parameters or files, and have nested for loops, you'll first want to enumerate all the combinations of what you are iterating over so you have one big loop. Then you want to add a few lines to your code to take in two arguments, the Task ID and the number of tasks, use those numbers to split up the thing you are iterating over. For example, I might have a list of filenames, <code>fnames</code>. In python I would add:</p> <pre><code># Grab the arguments that are passed in\nmy_task_id = int(sys.argv[1])\nnum_tasks = int(sys.argv[2])`\n\n# Assign indices to this process/task\nmy_fnames = fnames[my_task_id-1:len(fnames):num_tasks]\n\nfor f in my_fnames: ...\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that I am iterating over <code>my_fnames</code>, which is a subset of the full list of filenames determined by the task ID and number of tasks. This subset will be different for each task in the array. Note that the third line of code will be different for languages with arrays that start at index 1 (see the Julia Job Array code for an example of this).</p> <p>The submission script will look like this:</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH -o myScript.sh.log-%j-%a\n#SBATCH -a 1-4\n\n# Loading the required module(s)\nmodule load anaconda/2023a\n\npython top5each.py $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>-a</code> (or <code>--array</code>) option is where you specify your array indices, or task IDs. Here I am creating an array with four tasks by specifying 1 \"through\" 4. When the scheduler starts your job, it will start up four independent tasks, each will run this script, and each will have <code>#SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</code> set to its task ID. Similarly, <code>$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT</code> will be set to the total number of tasks, in this case 4.</p> <p>You may have noticed that there is an additional <code>%a</code> in the output file name. There will be one output file for each task in the array, and the <code>%a</code> puts the task ID on at the end of the filename, so you know which file goes with which task.</p> <p>By default you will get one core for each task in the array.

You can look through their documentation to see if there is a way to limit the number of cores it uses, or you can request an exclusive node.

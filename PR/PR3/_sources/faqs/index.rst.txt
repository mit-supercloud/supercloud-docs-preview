Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

This page contains the answers to a few questions that we receive often.
As more questions are asked, this page may be updated.

How do I get an account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To request an account, follow the instructions and answer the questions
on our :ref:`requesting_account`. We will reach
out to you once your account is created, or if we have any questions for
you.

I would like to log in from a new computer. Can I add a new ssh key?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a new computer, or want to add keys for additional computers
that you use, you can add your own key on our web portal. Instructions
on how to generate a new ssh key and add it to your account are on our
:ref:`Account Request Page<sshkeys>`. In
summary, log in with your credentials (for MIT and other educational
institutions this is the middle option when you go to
https://txe1-portal.mit.edu) and then click on the “sshkeys” link.
Scroll to the bottom and paste your key in the box.

How much storage do I have for my account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We do not impose storage limits. However, it is recommended that users
not use their accounts as primary storage. **Further, we do not back up
the storage on the system, so we strongly recommend transferring your
code, data, and any other important files to another machine for
backup.**

How can I share files/code/data with my colleagues?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to share files with others you can request a shared
group directory. Shared group directories are located at
/home/gridsan/groups and we will put a symlink in your home directory to
use as a shortcut to your shared group directory. To request one, send
email to
`supercloud@mit.edu <mailto:supercloud@mit.edu?subject=New%20Group%20Request&body=Hello%2C%0A%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20a%20new%20group.%20Here%20is%20the%20required%20information%3A%0A%0A1.%20Group%20name%3A%20%0A2.%20Group%20owner%2Fapprover%3A%0A3.%20Group%20members%3A%0A4.%20Any%20non-public%20data%3F%20If%20so%2C%20what%20requirements%2C%20restrictions%2C%20or%20agreements%20are%20associated%20with%20the%20data%3F%0A%0AThank%20you%2C%0A%0A>`__
and let us know:

#. What the group should be called. Short, descriptive names are best.
#. Who should be the owner/approver for the group. We will ask this
   person for approval whenever we receive a request to join a group.
#. Who should be in the group. Supercloud usernames are helpful, but not
   required.
#. Whether you plan to store any non-public data in the group. If you
   do, let us know what requirements, restrictions, or agreements are
   associated with the data. :ref:`See why we ask
   here<nonpublic_data>`.

To learn more about Shared Groups and best practices using them, see the
page on :ref:`shared_groups`.

How do I set/change my password?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You most likely do not need to set a password. If you have an active MIT
Kerberos or login from another University, you can most likely log in
using your institution's credentials. On the Supercloud Web Portal Login
page, select the middle option "MIT Touchstone/InCommon Federation". You
may have to select your institution from the dropdown list, which should
take you to your institution's login page. After you log in, you should
see the Portal main page. If you have trouble logging in this way,
please `contact us <https://supercloud.mit.edu/contact>`__ and we can
help.

If you cannot log in using "MIT Touchstone/InCommon Federation", we may
set you up with a password. If you have not yet reset your password, or
remember your previous password, then follow the instructions on the
:ref:`web_portal` page. If you have
previously set your password and cannot remember it, `contact
us <https://supercloud.mit.edu/contact>`__ and we will help you reset
your password.

Are there any resource limits?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New accounts are created with a small starting resource allocation. Once
you have completed the `Practical HPC
course <https://learn.llx.edly.io/course/practical-hpc/>`__ you can send
an email to supercloud@mit.edu to request to be moved to the standard
allocation. The starting and standard allocations are listed on the
:ref:`systems_and_software` page.

If you have a deadline and need additional resources you can request
more by `contacting us <https://supercloud.mit.edu/contact>`__. If you
looking to request more GPUs, please read through this page on
:ref:`gpu_jobs` first.
Please state the number of additional processors you need, the length of
time for which you need it, and tell us about the jobs you are running
and how you are submitting them. If you plan to run many independent
jobs we will ask you to convert your job to use :ref:`triples` before
giving and increased allocation. Remember this is a shared system, so
during busy times we may not be able to grant your request. We will also
only grant increase requests if you have completed the `Practical HPC
course <https://learn.llx.edly.io/course/practical-hpc/>`__.

It is also important to keep in mind what your fair share of memory is
for each process and :ref:`request additional
resources<slurm_memcores>`
if needed. For example, if there are 40 cores and 384GB of RAM on the
machine you are using, each processor's fair share would be about 9GB.
Check the :ref:`systems_and_software` page to see
how many cores and how much memory each node type has. If you think your
processes will go over this, request additional slots as needed. This
ensures you have sufficient memory without killing your job or someone
else's.

What do I do if my job won't be deleted?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Occasionally this will happen if the node where your job is running goes
down, or your job does not exit gracefully. If this happens, `contact
us <https://supercloud.mit.edu/contact>`__ with the Job ID, and we'll
delete the job and reboot the node if needed.

Why do I get an error when I try to install a package?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two common reasons you get an error when you try to install a
package. If you get a "Permission Denied" or similar error, it is
because you are trying to install the package system-wide, rather than
your own home directory. See the :ref:`software_and_packages`
page for more information on how to install packages.

If you get a "Network Error", or similar, this is because we don't have
internet/network connection on the compute nodes, this includes Jupyter
and any interactive jobs. You will have to install the package on one of
the login nodes.

If you get an error like
"``Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded``"
when installing a package with pip or something like
"``ERROR: could not download https://pkg.julialang.org/registry/...``"
installing a package with Julia, even though you are on the login node,
this is because it is filling up your quota in the ``/tmp`` directory.
We have set quotas on this directory to prevent a single person from
inadvertently filling it up, as when this happens it can cause issues
for everyone using the node, including preventing anyone from installing
packages. This can be fixed by setting the TMPIDR environment variable
like so:

   ``mkdir /state/partition1/user/$USER export TMPDIR=/state/partition1/user/$USER``

After you have installed your package you can clean up any lingering
files by removing the temporary directory you have created:

   ``rm -rf /state/partition1/user/$USER``


How can I set up VSCode to edit files remotely on Supercloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use VSCode to remotely connect to Supercloud via the Remote-SSH
extension. The default settings in the VSCode Remote - SSH extension
will fail to connect. This is due to it trying to lock files in your
home directory, which is disabled for performance reasons.

The solution is to have it use the local filesystem. To get it to work,
go to your VS Code settings, click “Extensions” and then “Remote - SSH”.
Once you're in the settings for Remote - SSH, check the box next to
“Remote.SSH: Lockfiles in Tmp”. What this will do is put any lockfiles
in /tmp, rather than your home directory.

A side note: we have seen VS Code clutter up /tmp in the past, which we
keep fairly small. Disconnecting occasionally should clean these up,
however we do not know for sure. If you can check it once in a while and
clean up any files that are yours in /tmp, that would be really helpful.

How can I use Tensorboard on Supercloud?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Take a look at this page on :ref:`how to run Tensorboard in an interactive
job <tensorboard>`.

I got an Out of Memory error. How can I figure out how much memory my job needs and request more?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is described on the Submitting Jobs page. If you submit your jobs
with ``sbatch``, check out :ref:`this
section<slurm-memcores>`,
and if you use ``LLsub`` take a look at :ref:`this
section<llsub-memcores>`.
As described in those links, you can check how much memory your job used
using the ``sacct`` command, then request enough additional cores for
the memory you need. Keep in mind that if your job was killed due to
high memory use, your job may not have gotten to the point of highest
memory use. To get an accurate measurement you can run your job on an
exclusive node long enough to reach the part of the job that would
consume the most memory, then stop the job and check the memory use with
``sacct``.

My Python/Julia job is running, but I don't see any output in the log files. What is going on?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Julia and Python will buffer output in batch jobs. This means they will
hold on to the output and print it out all at once, sometimes this isn't
until the end of a loop or the end of the program. You can force both to
print the output when it is produced. In Python you can do this by using
the ``-u`` flag when you call Python in your submission script (ex:
``python -u myscript.py``). In Julia you can do this by adding
``flush(stdout)`` after the print statements in your Julia script that
you'd like to print immediately (ex:
``println("Hello World!"); flush(stdout)``).

What does the Underutilizing/Oversubscribing the node warning message mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you launch a job in :ref:`triples
mode <#triples>`, the second
and third numbers you provide are the number of processes per node
(NPPN) and the number of threads per process (NT). You can multiply
these two numbers to get the total number of threads you will have
running on the node. You will usually get the best performance if you
have the same total number of threads as cores on the node. See the
:ref:`systems_and_software` page for a
list of how many cores are on each node type.

**Oversubscribing:** When you have more threads than the number of cores
on the node. Oversubscribing can overwhelm the node, which can slow your
job down or even cause it to fail. It can also be harmful for the node.
Reduce the number of threads per process or number of processes per node
so that the total number of threads is less than or equal to the number
of cores.

**Underutilizing:** When you have fewer threads than the number of cores
on the node you may be undersubscribing. This means you may not be
taking full advantage of the node. Many underlying packages and
libraries can take advantage of multithreading. You might try increasing
the number of threads per process, while avoiding oversubscribing, to
see if you get improved performance.

For more information on how to pick the best triple for your job, take a
look at the :ref:`#tuning` process and recommendations.

We have set quotas on this directory to prevent a single person from inadvertently filling it up, as when this happens it can cause issues for everyone using the node, including preventing anyone from installing packages. This can be fixed by setting the <code>TMPIDR</code> environment variable like so:</p> <pre><code>mkdir /state/partition1/user/$USER\nexport TMPDIR=/state/partition1/user/$USER\n</code></pre> <p>After you have installed your package you can clean up any lingering files by removing the temporary directory you have created:</p> <p><code>rm -rf /state/partition1/user/$USER</code></p>"},{"location":"faqs/#how-can-i-set-up-vscode-to-edit-files-remotely-on-supercloud","title":"How can I set up VSCode to edit files remotely on Supercloud?","text":"<p>You can use VSCode to remotely connect to Supercloud via the Remote-SSH extension. The default settings in the VSCode Remote - SSH extension will fail to connect. This is due to it trying to lock files in your home directory, which is disabled for performance reasons.</p> <p>The solution is to have it use the local filesystem. To get it to work, go to your VS Code settings, click \"Extensions\" and then \"Remote - SSH\". Once you're in the settings for Remote - SSH, check the box next to \"Remote.SSH: Lockfiles in Tmp\". What this will do is put any lockfiles in /tmp, rather than your home directory.</p> <p>A side note: we have seen VS Code clutter up /tmp in the past, which we keep fairly small. Disconnecting occasionally should clean these up, however we do not know for sure.

See the Systems and Software page for a list of how many cores are on each node type.</p> <p>Oversubscribing: When you have more threads than the number of cores on the node. Oversubscribing can overwhelm the node, which can slow your job down or even cause it to fail. It can also be harmful for the node. Reduce the number of threads per process or number of processes per node so that the total number of threads is less than or equal to the number of cores.</p> <p>Underutilizing: When you have fewer threads than the number of cores on the node you may be undersubscribing. This means you may not be taking full advantage of the node. Many underlying packages and libraries can take advantage of multithreading.

That doesn't mean you have to be a Linux expert to use the system! However the more you can get comfortable with the Linux command line and a handful of basic commands, the easier using the system will be. If you are already familiar with Linux, feel free to skip this section, or skim as a refresher.</p> <p>Most Linux commands deal with directories and files. A directory, synonymous to a folder, contains files and other directories. The list of directories that lead to a particular directory or file is called its path. In Linux, directories on a path are separated by forward slashes <code>/</code>. It is also important to note that everything in Linux is case sensitive, so a file <code>myScript.sh</code> is not the same as the file <code>myscript.sh</code>. When you first log in you are in you home directory. Your home directory is where you can put all the code and data you need to run your job. Your home directory is not accessible to other users, if you need a space to share files with other users, let us know and we can make a shared group directory for you. The path to your home directory on SuperCloud is <code>/home/gridsan/[USERNAME]</code>, where <code>[USERNAME]</code> is your username. The character <code>~</code> is also shorthand for your home directory in any Linux commands.</p> <p>Anytime after you start typing a Linux command you can press the \"Tab\" button your your keyboard. This called tab-complete, and will try to autocomplete what you are typing. This is particularly helpful when typing out long directory paths and file names. Pressing \"Tab\" once will complete if there is a single completion, pressing it twice will list all potential completions. It is a bit difficult to explain in text, but you can try it out yourself and watch the short demonstration here.</p> <p>Finally, below is a list of Linux Commands. Try them out for yourself at the command line.</p> <ul> <li>Creating, navigating and viewing directories:<ul> <li><code>pwd</code>: tells you the full path of the directory you are     currently in</li> <li><code>mkdir dirname</code>: creates a directory with the name \"dirname\"</li> <li><code>cd dirname</code>: change directory to directory \"dirname\"<ul> <li><code>cd ../</code>: takes you up one level</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>ls</code>: lists the files in the directory<ul> <li><code>ls -a</code>: lists all files including hidden files</li> <li><code>ls -l</code>: lists files in \"long format\" including ownership     and date of last update</li> <li><code>ls -t</code>: lists files by date stamp, most recently updated     file first</li> <li><code>ls -tr</code>: lists files by dates stamp in reverse order, most     recently updated file is listed last (this is useful if you     have a lot of files, you want to know which file you changed     last and the list of files results in a scrolling window)</li> <li><code>ls dirname</code>: lists the files in the directory \"dirname\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Viewing files<ul> <li><code>more filename</code>: shows the first part of a file, hitting the     space bar allows you to scroll through the rest of the file, q     will cause you to exit out of the file.</li> <li><code>less filename</code>: allows you to scroll through the file, forward     and backward, using the arrow keys.</li> <li><code>tail filename</code>: shows the last 10 lines of a file (useful when     you are monitoring a logfile or output file to see that the     values are correct)<ul> <li>t<code>ail &lt;number&gt; filename</code>: show you the last &lt;number&gt;     lines of a file.</li> <li><code>tail -f filename</code>: shows you new lines as they are written     to the end of the file.

Go to\u00a0https://txe1-portal.mit.edu/. If you affiliated with MIT or another institution/university select the middle option \"MIT Touchstone/InCommon Federation\" to log in. Select your institution from the dropdown (be aware they are spelled out, MIT is listed as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example), click \"Remember my choice\" box and then the \"Select\" button. Then log in with your institution credentials. Once you are logged in, click on the \"sshkeys\" link and paste your ssh key in the box at the bottom of the page and click \"Update Keys\".</p> <p>For instructions on how to generate ssh keys, retrieve your public key, and additional troubleshooting tips, watch the videos in the \"Account Setup and SSH Keys\" section in the \"Getting Started\" module of the Practical HPC course, or see this page.</p> <p>First open a command line terminal window where you generated your ssh keys. Enter the following command, where <code>USERNAME</code> is your username on the MIT SuperCloud system:</p> <p><code>ssh USERNAME@txe1-login.mit.edu</code></p> <p>If you generated your keys using PuTTY, open a PuTTY window. In the box labeled \"Host Name\" enter<code>USERNAME@txe1-login.mit.edu</code>, where<code>USERNAME</code>is your username on the MIT SuperCloud system. Keep the ssh box checked (this should be default) and Port should be set to 22. Click \"Open\" to start the session. You may also need to indicate your private key on the Connection -&gt; SSH -&gt; Auth page.</p>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"getting-started/#shared-hpc-clusters_1","title":"Shared HPC Clusters","text":"<p>The MIT SuperCloud is an HPC-style shared cluster. You are sharing this resources with a number of other researchers, staff, and students so it is important that you read this page and use the system as intended.</p> <p>Being a cluster, there are several machines connected together with a network. We refer to these as nodes. Most nodes in the cluster are referred to as compute nodes, this is where the computation is done on the system (where you will run your code). When you ssh into the system you are on a special purpose node called the login node. The login node, as its name suggests, is where you log in and is for editing code and files, installing packages and software, downloading data, and starting jobs to run your code on one of the compute nodes.</p> <p>Each job is started using a piece of software called the scheduler, which you can think of as a resource manager. You let it know what resources you need and what you want to run, and the scheduler will find those resources and start your job on them. When your job completes those resources are relinquished. The scheduler is what ensures that no two jobs are using the same resources, so it is very important not to run anything unless it is submitted properly through the scheduler.</p>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"getting-started/#software-and-packages_1","title":"Software and Packages","text":"<p>The first thing you may want to do is make sure the system has the software and packages you need.

If you are ever unsure if we have a particular software, and you cannot find it, please send us an email and ask before you spend a lot of time trying to install it. If we have it, we can point you to it, provide advice on how to use it, and if we don't have it we can often give pointers on how to install it.

That doesn't mean you have to be a Linux expert to use the system! However the more you can get comfortable with the Linux command line and a handful of basic commands, the easier using the system will be. If you are already familiar with Linux, feel free to skip this section, or skim as a refresher.</p> <p>Most Linux commands deal with directories and files. A directory, synonymous to a folder, contains files and other directories. The list of directories that lead to a particular directory or file is called its path. In Linux, directories on a path are separated by forward slashes <code>/</code>. It is also important to note that everything in Linux is case sensitive, so a file <code>myScript.sh</code> is not the same as the file <code>myscript.sh</code>. When you first log in you are in you home directory. Your home directory is where you can put all the code and data you need to run your job. Your home directory is not accessible to other users, if you need a space to share files with other users, let us know and we can make a shared group directory for you. The path to your home directory on SuperCloud is <code>/home/gridsan/[USERNAME]</code>, where <code>[USERNAME]</code> is your username. The character <code>~</code> is also shorthand for your home directory in any Linux commands.</p> <p>Anytime after you start typing a Linux command you can press the \"Tab\" button your your keyboard. This called tab-complete, and will try to autocomplete what you are typing. This is particularly helpful when typing out long directory paths and file names. Pressing \"Tab\" once will complete if there is a single completion, pressing it twice will list all potential completions. It is a bit difficult to explain in text, but you can try it out yourself and watch the short demonstration here.</p> <p>Finally, below is a list of Linux Commands. Try them out for yourself at the command line.</p> <ul> <li>Creating, navigating and viewing directories:<ul> <li><code>pwd</code>: tells you the full path of the directory you are     currently in</li> <li><code>mkdir dirname</code>: creates a directory with the name \"dirname\"</li> <li><code>cd dirname</code>: change directory to directory \"dirname\"<ul> <li><code>cd ../</code>: takes you up one level</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>ls</code>: lists the files in the directory<ul> <li><code>ls -a</code>: lists all files including hidden files</li> <li><code>ls -l</code>: lists files in \"long format\" including ownership     and date of last update</li> <li><code>ls -t</code>: lists files by date stamp, most recently updated     file first</li> <li><code>ls -tr</code>: lists files by dates stamp in reverse order, most     recently updated file is listed last (this is useful if you     have a lot of files, you want to know which file you changed     last and the list of files results in a scrolling window)</li> <li><code>ls dirname</code>: lists the files in the directory \"dirname\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Viewing files<ul> <li><code>more filename</code>: shows the first part of a file, hitting the     space bar allows you to scroll through the rest of the file, q     will cause you to exit out of the file.</li> <li><code>less filename</code>: allows you to scroll through the file, forward     and backward, using the arrow keys.</li> <li><code>tail filename</code>: shows the last 10 lines of a file (useful when     you are monitoring a logfile or output file to see that the     values are correct)<ul> <li>t<code>ail &lt;number&gt; filename</code>: show you the last &lt;number&gt;     lines of a file.</li> <li><code>tail -f filename</code>: shows you new lines as they are written     to the end of the file.

GPUs are used as an accelerator for certain matrix   operations.</p> <p>Bandwidth A theoretical measure of how much data could be transferred from   source to destination in a given amount of time.</p> <p>Bash shell A specific shell and language used at the command line. This is the   shell used on SuperCloud.</p> <p>Bash script/Shell script A script using bash command syntax.</p> <p>Batch job A job for running a pre-written script or executable. Resources are   requested through the scheduler, the schedule allocates the resources   when they are available, runs the script, and then exits.</p> <p>Cluster Many nodes connected via a fast network interconnect.</p> <p>Command Line A text-based user interface that allows a user to type commands that   the computer then executes.</p> <p>Compute Nodes Nodes where the computation is done on the system (where you will run   your code). Compute nodes are managed by the scheduler.</p> <p>Core A core is the smallest computation unit that can run a program.</p> <p>CPU The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of a computer which   executes software programs. CPU refers to an individual silicon chip,   such as Intel's Xeon-E5 or AMD's Opteron. \u00a0A CPU contains one or   more cores. \u00a0Also known as a processor or socket.</p> <p>Data Server Also called an Object Storage Server. A component of a parallel file   system which stores all of the data of the files on the file system.</p> <p>(Job) Dependency Defer the start of a job until the specified dependencies have been   satisfied completed. This is usually the completion of another job.</p> <p>Distributed Memory (see \"Memory Models\") In\u00a0a distributed memory system, each CPU has its own private memory.   Processes can only operate on local data. If remote data is required,   the process must communicate with the remote process over an   interconnect.</p> <p>Downtime A regular maintenance day during which the system is unavailable.</p> <p>Environment Variable Environment variables allow you to customize the environment in which   programs run. They become part of the environment in which the   programs run and can be queried by running programs. For example, you   can set an environment variable to contain the path to your data   files. Your running process can query this environment variable to get   the location of the files.</p> <p>File Permissions Properties of a file that determine who can read, write, or execute   (run) a file.</p> <p>Filesystem The system that controls how and where data is stored on storage disk.   See Shared/Central Filesystem and Local Filesystem.</p> <p>GPU A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized device originally   used to generate computer output. \u00a0Each compute node can host one or   more GPUs. \u00a0Modern GPUs have many simple compute cores and have been   used for parallel processing.</p> <p>Group Shared Directory A directory, created upon user request, where members of the group   shared directory can share files with other members of the group.   \u00a0Since a user's home directory is accessible only to the user, a group   shared directory is the only mechanism for users to share files.</p> <p>GUI Graphical User Interface- these are interfaces that allow the user to   interact with a program with a mouse through visual icons, as opposed   to a command line interface.</p> <p>Home Directory Where the user keeps their files. Each user has their own home   directory.</p> <p>HPC High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of aggregating   computing power to achieve higher performance that would not possible   by using a typical computer.\u00a0 The community often used\u00a0concurrent   computing\u00a0to mean programs running at the same time v in serial one   after another.</p> <p>Hub A networking component that takes an incoming message and broadcasts   it across all of the other ports of the hub.</p> <p>Independent (Tasks/Processes) Tasks/processes that can operate by themselves without needing data   from another.</p> <p>Interactive Job An interactive job allows you to actually log in to a compute node.   This is useful for when you need to compile software, test jobs and   scripts, or run software that requires keyboard inputs and user   interaction, such as a graphical interface\u00a0.</p> <p>Interconnects The connections between components of the computer (this interconnect   is called the System Network), and the computer to the Internet   network (this interconnect is called the Network Connection).</p> <p>I/O (Input/Output) Refers operations that involve a transfer of data, particularly   reading from and writing to the filesystem.</p> <p>Job A job is a separately executable unit of work whose resources are   allocated and shared. \u00a0Users create job submission scripts to ask the   scheduler for resources (cores, a specific processor type, etc). \u00a0The   scheduler places the requests in a queue and allocates the requested   resources.</p> <p>Job Array According to the Slurm documentation: \u00a0\"Job arrays offer a mechanism   for submitting and managing collections of similar jobs quickly and   easily\". \u00a0 Job arrays are useful for applying the same processing   routine to a collection of multiple inputs, data, or files. \u00a0Job   arrays offer a very simple way to submit a large number of independent   or\u00a0High Throughput\u00a0processing jobs.</p> <p>Job Slot A computational resource unit that is roughly equivalent to a   processor core.

In MIMO mode your application iterates through multiple   inputs. LLMapReduce calls and loads your application once in order to   process multiple assigned inputs.</p> <p>Modules Here we are referring to \"environment modules\", but we often refer   to them just as \"modules\". An open source software management tool   used in most HPC facilities. \u00a0Using modules enable users to   selectively pick the software that they want and add them to their   environment. \u00a0Using the module command, you can manipulate your   environment to gain access to new software or different versions of a   package.</p> <p>MPI The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library for passing messages   between processes and between compute nodes within a parallel job   running on a cluster. There are a variety of open source and   commercial versions of MPI that have\u00a0been developed over the past   several decades including mpich,\u00a0 OpenMPI, and Intel MPI.</p> <p>Multi-Threaded Describes an application that uses multiple threads.

For example, the   absolute path to the home directory for studentx would be:   /home/gridsan/studentx.</p> <p>Relative\u00a0Path The path to a file or directory from the current location.</p> <p>Process An independent computation running on a computer. \u00a0Processes have   their own address space and may create threads that will share their   address space. \u00a0Processes must use interprocess communication to   communicate with other processes.</p> <p>Router A networking component that acts as a special switch that moves   messages across defined network boundaries.</p> <p>Rsync A command for transferring and syncing files between systems.</p> <p>Scheduler The scheduler receives job and task execution requests from users and   manages how and where they are executed across the many compute nodes   in the HPC system. Before starting a job, it ensures that the needed   resources are available for the job. The scheduler monitors running   jobs, can stop jobs, and can provide information about completed jobs   and the status of the system (e.g. what resources are currently   available).</p> <p>Shared/Central Filesystem The shared filesystem is the filesystem that is available to all nodes   in the cluster. Home and group directories are on the shared   filesystem.</p> <p>Shared Memory\u00a0(see \"Memory Models\") In\u00a0a shared memory system, there is shared memory that can be   simultaneously accessed by multiple CPUs in a multiprocessor CPU.   Communication or data passing among threads or processes in a shared   memory system is via memory.</p> <p>Shell Another term for the Linux command line interface.</p> <p>SISO Mode Single input, single output is an application mode for use   with\u00a0LLMapReduce. In SISO mode, your application runs on a single   input. LLMapReduce calls and loads your application once in order to   process one assigned input.</p> <p>Slurm Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is a job   scheduler which coordinates the running of many programs on a shared   facility. \u00a0Slurm is used on the MIT SuperCloud system. \u00a0It replaced   the SGE scheduler.</p> <p>Socket A computational unit packaged as one, and usually made of a single   chip often called processor. \u00a0Modern sockets carry many cores.</p> <p>SPMD Single Program Multiple Data</p> <p>SSH Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol to securely access remote computers.   \u00a0Based on the client-server model, users with an SSH client can access   a remote computer. \u00a0Some operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS   have a built-in SSH client and others can use one of many publicly   available clients. \u00a0For Windows, we recommend PuTTY or Cygwin for ssh.</p> <p>SSH Keys Credentials used as an authentication method for ssh. These come in   pairs: a public and private key. Public keys are placed on the system   you need to access, private keys are placed on your computer. When you   ssh in the ssh program checks to see whether the public key fits your   private key.</p> <p>Submission/batch script A script for submitting a batch job to the scheduler. It is a bash   script that tells the scheduler how to run your job, and may include   the resources you are requesting for you job.</p> <p>Switch A networking component that is more efficient than a hub. It takes an   incoming network message and sends it out only onto the switch port on   which its destination will be reached. Switches only transmit messages   within a defined network.</p> <p>Symlink Short for symbolic link. A file that acts as a shortcut by pointing to   another file or directory on the filesystem. If you are in a group you   may see a symbolic link to the shared group directory in your home   directory.</p> <p>Terminal (Window) A window containing a command line prompt.</p> <p>Third-party software According to Wikipedia: a third-party software component is a reusable   software component developed to be either freely distributed or sold   by an entity other than the original vendor of the development   platform.\u00a0</p> <p>Examples of third-party software on the SuperCloud system include MATLAB and TensorFlow.\u00a0</p> <p>Thread Threads are lightweight processes which exist within a single   operating system process. \u00a0Threads share the address space of the   process that created them and can communicate directly with other   threads in the same process.</p> <p>Throughput An actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from   source to destination in a given amount of time.</p> <p>Throughput (Workflow) A throughput application is one that is fully independent. Often this   means it is running the same operation on a number of different inputs   or parameters, and the result of an operation on one input does not   depend on the result of another.</p> <p>Triples (Mode) A job submission mode that allows you to request resources in a   triple: Number of Nodes, Number of Processes per Node, and Number of   Threads per Process. Available for LLsub job arrays, LLMapReduce, and   pMatlab jobs.</p> <p>Ubpn Average observed Used bytes per node.</p> <p>Ubpp Average observed Used bytes per process.</p> <p>Unix, Linux Unix is a family of portable, multi-tasking, multi-user operating   systems.

To explicitly define permissions you will need to reference the Permission Group and Permission Types:</p> <ul> <li>The Permission Groups are:\u00a0 u -- Owner\u00a0 \u00a0g -- Group\u00a0 o -- Others\u00a0\u00a0</li> <li>The Permission Types are:\u00a0 r -- Read\u00a0 w -- Write\u00a0 \u00a0x -- Execute</li> </ul> <p>The first of these triplets represent the Owner's permissions, the second the Group's, and the third Others'. An r,w, or x represent the ability to perform that action, and a \"-\" means that action is not permitted. For a file like <code>logfile1</code> above you can see that it is owned by user <code>studenty</code> (from group <code>studenty</code>) and only the owner has read and write permissions. The file named <code>logfile2</code> currently has the permissions set to <code>-rw-rw----</code>, which means that the owner and group have read and write permission. SuperCloud does not allow you to add read, write, or execute permissions for others, or all users. One important thing to note: in order to go into a directory you must have execute permissions on that directory. So if you get a \"Permission denied\" error when trying to enter or look at the files in a directory, check whether the directory has read and execute permissions.</p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/files-and-data/shared-groups/#changing-file-permissions","title":"Changing File Permissions","text":"<p>Now say we want to change permissions for a file. One of the easiest ways is to use the Assignment Operators, + (plus) and -- (minus). These are used to tell the system whether to add or remove the specific permissions.</p> <p>For example, to add group read and write permission for <code>logfile1</code>, you would invoke the command:</p> <p><code>chmod g+rw logfile1</code></p> <p>Now say you want your group to be able to read <code>logfile2</code>, but don't want anyone to accidentally modify it. To remove group write permissions you would invoke the command:</p> <p><code>chmod g-w logfile2</code></p> <p>It's very important to know that if you want to apply these changes recursively that you use the <code>-R</code> (with a capital R) flag. Using a lowercase <code>-r</code> flag like you do for other Linux commands like <code>cp</code> will remove write permissions for everyone, including yourself. If you make this mistake, it is not the end of the world, but you will need to send us an email and have us fix it.</p> <p>Alternately you can define the full permissions options with binary references like <code>chmod 750 logfile1</code> which would grant full privileges (7) to the owner, and rw privileges (5) to the group and nothing (0) to others in a single command. You can learn more options and about chmod either from an online tutorial or from your local man pages (<code>man chmod</code>, typing <code>q</code>\u00a0will exit) or with the quick cheat sheet you can display with <code>chmod --help</code>. The following is also pretty good tutorial, but be aware it talks about permissions in general, and not everything will be relevant to shared groups or Supercloud: How to use the chmod Command on Linux.</p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/files-and-data/shared-groups/#linux-file-ownership","title":"Linux File Ownership","text":"<p>If we take another look at the example directory above:</p> <pre><code>drwxrwx---\u00a0 \u00a0 2 studentz studentz\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04096 Jun 15 14:51\u00a0 mydirectory\nlrwxrwxrwx\u00a0 \u00a0 1 root\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0root\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 26 Jun 15 17:24\u00a0 files_shared -&gt; ../groups/fileshare\n-rw-rw----\u00a0 \u00a0 1 studenty studenty\u00a0 \u00a0 4096 Jun 30 09:02\u00a0 logfile1\n-rw-r----\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01 studentx Alpha\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04096 Jun 30 09:02\u00a0 logfile2\n-rw-r-x---\u00a0 \u00a0 1 studenty studenty\u00a0 \u00a0 4096 Jun 30 09:02\u00a0 myscript.py\n</code></pre> <p>the 12th and 13th column of the <code>ls -l</code> output is the owner of the file, listed first, and the group for the file, listed second.

Based on the permissions above, <code>studentx</code> can read and write to the file, and anyone in the <code>Alpha</code> group can read the file, but cannot write to it.</p> <p>In a group directory the group owner for a file should usually be the group associated with that directory. Sometimes it unintentionally gets set to the username of the person who created or put the file there. This can easily be remedied by using the <code>chgrp</code> command. For example, let's say we'd like everyone in the <code>Alpha</code> group to be able to read and run (execute) the file <code>myscript.py</code>, but not have write permissions. The group permissions are set properly, but the group is set to <code>studenty</code>\u00a0instead of <code>Alpha</code>.

In most cases, this can be done in a few easy steps.</p> <p>What is triples mode? It's a different way to submit your job by specifying three numbers:</p> <ul> <li>Nodes: The number of nodes you want to use up</li> <li>NPPN: The number of processes that should run per node</li> <li>NTPP: The number of threads per process</li> </ul> <p>Why would you want to use triples mode to submit your job? Triples mode provides a few advantages. Since it does whole-node scheduling you don't have to worry about other jobs impacting yours (or your job impacting someone else's). We also do task-pinning when you request resources with a triple, so your processes are arranged in the best way possible for the layout of the hardware architecture. Finally, submitting a Job Array with LLsub triples mode the way we describe here will greatly reduce the startup time for your jobs, over a job array with many pending tasks.</p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/submitting-jobs/job-array-triples/#step-1-batch-up-your-array","title":"Step 1: Batch Up your Array","text":"<p>The first thing you want to do is set up your job so that your script splits up your inputs among each process/task and each process/task iterates a subset of your inputs. This way you can change your input set without changing the number of tasks or processes that you schedule. This step alone will save you on startup time. Anytime you submit more jobs than your allocation allows, those additional jobs will remaining pending until some of your first running jobs complete. Then, when one of your first jobs complete, the scheduler now has to find the pending job some resources and start it running. If you batch up your job array, you only have to go through the scheduling process once. If you've set up a job array following our instructions in the past you may already be doing this, and you can skip to the next section.</p> <p>First you want to take a look at your code. Code that can be submitted as a Job Array usually has one big for loop. If you are iterating over multiple parameters or files, and have nested for loops, you'll first want to enumerate all the combinations of what you are iterating over so you have one big loop.</p> <p>If your code is written so it uses the <code>$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</code> and uses that to run a single thing, first add a for loop that iterates over the full set of things you want to run your code on. If you can't rewrite your code in such a way that it iterates over multiple inputs, you can use LLMapReduce to submit your job with triples mode, see this example.</p> <p>Then you add a few lines to your code to take in two arguments, a process/task ID and the number of processes/tasks, and use those numbers to split up the thing you are iterating over. For example, I might have a list of filenames, <code>fnames</code>. In python I would add:</p> PythonJulia <pre><code># Grab the arguments that are passed in\nmy_task_id = int(sys.argv[1])\nnum_tasks = int(sys.argv[2])\n# Assign indices to this process/task\nmy_fnames = fnames[my_task_id:len(fnames):num_tasks]\nfor f in my_fnames: ...\n</code></pre> <pre><code># Grab the arguments that are passed in\ntask_id = parse(Int,ARGS[1])\nnum_tasks = parse(Int,ARGS[2])\n# Assign indices to this process/task\nmy_fnames = fnames[task_id+1:num_tasks:length(fnames)]\nfor f in my_fnames\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that I am iterating over <code>my_fnames</code>, which is a subset of the full list of filenames determined by the task ID and number of tasks. This subset will be different for each task in the array. Note that the third line of code will be different for languages with arrays that start at index 1 (see the Julia Job Array code for an example of this).</p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/submitting-jobs/job-array-triples/#step-2-changing-your-submission-script","title":"Step 2: Changing Your Submission Script","text":"<p>If you have been running your Job Arrays with sbatch, you most likely have a few environment variables in your submission script.

If <code>NTPP</code>=2, <code>NPPN</code> should be at most 24, etc. The numbers you choose depend on your application, if it is multithreaded it may be worth increasing <code>NTPP</code> and decreasing <code>NPPN</code>. If your application consumes a lot of memory, you may need to decrease <code>NPPN</code> so each process has the memory it needs to proceed.

One advantage of this is it makes for a more compact <code>LLstat</code> output that is easier to read, instead of having to scroll through tons of tasks.</p> <p>You can check on your individual processes by looking at the log files. LLsub with Triples mode will create a directory with the prefix \"LLSUB\" followed by a unique number to hold all the log files.

Non-Distributed programs you may see referred to as shared memory or multithreaded. Python's multiprocessing package is a good example of a shared memory library.

You also want to think about what you are running: if you are running a series of identical independent tasks, say you are running the same code over a number of files or parameters, this is referred to as Throughput and can be run in parallel using a Job Array. (If you are iterating over files like this, and have some reduction step at the end, take a look at LLMapReduce).

See the page LLsub Job Array Triples to see how to set this up.</p> <p>A simple way to run the same script or command with different parameters or on different files in parallel is by using a Job Array. With a Job Array, the parallelism happens at the Scheduler level and is completely language agnostic. The best way to use a Job Array is to batch up your parameters so you have a finite number of tasks each running a set of parameters, rather than one task for each parameter. In your submission script you specify numeric indices, corresponding to the number of tasks that you want running at once. Those indices, or Task IDs are captured in environment variables, along with the total number of tasks, and passed into your script. Your script then has the information it needs to split up the work among tasks. This process is described in the Teaching Examples github repository, with examples in Julia and Python.</p> <p>First you want to take a look at your code. Code that can be submitted as a Job Array usually has one big for loop. If you are iterating over multiple parameters or files, and have nested for loops, you'll first want to enumerate all the combinations of what you are iterating over so you have one big loop. Then you want to add a few lines to your code to take in two arguments, the Task ID and the number of tasks, use those numbers to split up the thing you are iterating over. For example, I might have a list of filenames, <code>fnames</code>. In python I would add:</p> <pre><code># Grab the arguments that are passed in\nmy_task_id = int(sys.argv[1])\nnum_tasks = int(sys.argv[2])`\n# Assign indices to this process/task\nmy_fnames = fnames[my_task_id-1:len(fnames):num_tasks]\nfor f in my_fnames: ...\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that I am iterating over <code>my_fnames</code>, which is a subset of the full list of filenames determined by the task ID and number of tasks. This subset will be different for each task in the array. Note that the third line of code will be different for languages with arrays that start at index 1 (see the Julia Job Array code for an example of this).</p> <p>The submission script will look like this:</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH -o myScript.sh.log-%j-%a\n#SBATCH -a 1-4\n# Loading the required module(s)\nmodule load anaconda/2023a\n\npython top5each.py $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>-a</code> (or <code>--array</code>) option is where you specify your array indices, or task IDs. Here I am creating an array with four tasks by specifying 1 \"through\" 4. When the scheduler starts your job, it will start up four independent tasks, each will run this script, and each will have <code>#SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</code> set to its task ID. Similarly, <code>$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT</code> will be set to the total number of tasks, in this case 4.</p> <p>You may have noticed that there is an additional <code>%a</code> in the output file name. There will be one output file for each task in the array, and the <code>%a</code> puts the task ID on at the end of the filename, so you know which file goes with which task.</p> <p>By default you will get one core for each task in the array. If you need more than one core for each task, take a look at the cpus-per-task option, and if you need to add a GPU to each task, check out the the GPUs section.</p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/submitting-jobs/submitting-jobs/#exclusive-nodes","title":"Exclusive Nodes","text":"<p>Requesting an exclusive node ensures that there will be no other users on the node with you.

There is some software that have not been designed for a shared HPC environment, and so use all the cores on the node, whether you have allocated them or not. You can look through their documentation to see if there is a way to limit the number of cores it uses, or you can request an exclusive node.

In addition to MATLAB(R), pMatlab works seamlessly with Octave, and open source Matlab toolkit.</p> <p>MATLAB(R) is the primary development language used by Laboratory staff, and thus the place to start when developing an infrastructure aimed at removing the traditional hurdles associated with parallel computing. In an effort to develop a tool that will enable the researcher to seamlessly move from desktop (serial) to parallel computing, pMatlab has adopted the use of Global Array Semantics. Global Array Semantics is a parallel programming model in which the programmer views an array as a single global array rather than multiple subarrays located on different processors. The ability to access and manipulate related data distributed across processors as a single array more closely matches the serial programming model than the traditional parallel approach, which requires keeping track of which data resides on any given individual processor.</p> <p>Along with global array semantics, pMatlab uses the message-passing capabilities of MatlabMPI to provide a global array interface to MATLAB(R)) programmers. The ultimate goal of pMatlab is to move beyond basic messaging (and its inherent programming complexity) towards higher level parallel data structures and functions, allowing MATLAB(R)) users to parallelize their existing programs by simply changing and adding a few lines.</p> <p>Any pMatlab code can be run on the MIT Supercloud using standard pMatlab submission commands. The Practical High Performance Computing course on our online course platform provides a very good introduction for how to use pMatlab. There is also an examples directory in your home directory that provides several examples. The Param_Sweep example is a good place to start. There is an in-depth explanation of this example in the Teaching Examples github repository.</p> <p>If you anticipate that your job will use more than 4 GB of RAM, you may need to allocated more resources for your job. You can be sure your job has enough memory to run by allocating more slots, or cores, to each task or process in your job. For example, our xeon-p8 nodes have 48 cores and 192 GB of RAM, therefore each core represents about 4 GB. So if your job needs ~8 GB, allocate two cores or slots per process. Doing so will ensure your job will not fail due running out of memory, and not interfere with someone else's job.</p> <p>To do this with pMatlab, you can add the following line to your run script, before you the <code>eval(pRUN(...))</code> command:</p> <p><code>setenv('GRIDMATLAB_MT_SLOTS','2')</code></p>"},{"location":"using-the-system/submitting-jobs/submitting-jobs/#submitting-with-llsub-or-sbatch","title":"Submitting with LLsub or Sbatch","text":"<p>You can always submit a Matlab(R) script with a submission script through sbatch or LLsub.

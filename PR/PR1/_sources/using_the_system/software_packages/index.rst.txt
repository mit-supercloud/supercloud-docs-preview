Software and Package Management
===============================

The standard environment on the MIT Supercloud System is sufficient for
most. If it is not, first check to see if the tool you need is included
in a module. `Modules <#modules>`__ contain environment variables that
set you up to use other software, packages, or compilers not included in
the standard stack. If there is no module with what you need, you can
often `install your package or software in your home
directory <#home-install>`__. Below we have instructions on how to
install `Julia <#julia>`__, `Python <#python>`__, and `R <#R>`__
packages. If you have explored both these options or are having trouble,
`contact us <https://supercloud.mit.edu/contact>`__.

Modules
-------

Modules are a handy way to set up environment variables for particular
work, especially in a shared environment. They provide an easy way to
load a particular version of a language or compiler.

To see what modules are available, type the command:

   ``module avail``

See a list currently the modules available
`here <https://supercloud.mit.edu/systems-and-software#modules>`__.

To load a module, use the command:

   ``module load moduleName``

Where ``moduleName`` can be any of the modules listed by the module
avail command.

If you want to list the modules you currently have loaded, you can use
the module list command:

   ``module list``

If you want to change to a different version of the module you have
loaded, you can switch the module you have loaded. This is important to
do when loading a different version of a module you already have loaded,
as environment variables from one version could interfere with those of
another. To switch modules:

   ``module switch oldModuleName newModuleName``

Where ``oldModuleName`` is the name of the module you currently have
loaded, and ``newModuleName`` is the new module that you would like to
load.

If you would like to unload the module, or remove the changes the module
has made to your environment, use the following command:

   ``module unload moduleName``

Finally, in order to use the module command inside a script, you will
need to initialize it first.

The following shows a Bourne shell script example:

   ``#!/bin/bash``
   ``# Initialize the module command first source``
   ``source /etc/profile``
   ``# Then use the module command to load the module needed for your work``
   ``module load anaconda/2020a``

Installing Software or Packages in your Home Directory
------------------------------------------------------

Many packages and software can be installed in user space, meaning they
are installed just for the user installing the package or software. The
way to do this for Julia, Python, and R packages is described below. For
other software, look at their installation documentation and see if they
have instructions on how to install in your home directory. Sometimes
this is described changing the installation location. Often you will
have to download the source and build the software in your home
directory to do this. Any dependencies can usually be installed in a
similar way. If you run into trouble installing software you can `reach
out to us for
help <mailto:supercolud@mit.edu?subject=Help%20Installing%20Software>`__.
Let us know what you have tried so far and we can often point you in the
right direction.

Julia Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding new packages in Julia doesn't require doing anything special. On
the login node, load a julia module and start Julia. You can enter
package mode by pressing the "``]``" key and entering
``add packagename``, where ``packagename`` is the name of your package.
Or you can load ``Pkg`` and run ``Pkg.add("packagename")``.

The easiest way to check if a package already exists is to try to load
it by running ``using packagename``. The ``Pkg.status()`` command will
only show packages that you have added to your home environment. If you
would like a list of the packages we have installed, the following lines
should do the trick (where v1.# is your version number, for example
v1.3):

   ``using Pkg; Pkg.activate(DEPOT_PATH[2]*"/environments/v1.3"); installed_pkgs = Pkg.installed(); Pkg.activate(DEPOT_PATH[1]*"/environments/v1.3"); installed_pkgs``

If you get an error trying to install a Julia package, first check to
make sure you are on the login node, as the compute nodes don't have
internet access. If you are already on the login node, it is possible
that the installation is filling up the ``/tmp`` directory. The errors
for this can be vague and differ between the different Julia versions.
You can try changing the temporary directory that Julia uses to
unpackage its packages for installation by setting the ``$TMPDIR``
environment variable. You can create the new temporary directory and set
the environment variable like this:

   ``mkdir /state/partition1/user/$USER   export TMPDIR=/state/partition1/user/$USER``

Once you have done this you can start up Julia and install packages as
you normally would. Once you are done it is good practice to delete
these temporary files.

**Note:** If you are using Jupyter there is an additional step you can
optionally do so that Jupyter can find both our installed packages and
your own. You can also run this if you are missing a Julia Kernel. First
load a Julia module. Then, in a Julia shell, run:

   ``using IJulia   installkernel("Julia MyKernel", env=Dict("JULIA_LOAD_PATH"=>ENV["JULIA_LOAD_PATH"]))``

The first part "Julia MyKernel" is what you want to call your kernel, so
feel free to change this. The second part makes sure both our packages
and any you've installed in your home directory show up on the load path
when you use a Jupyter Notebook with this kernel.

Python Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many python packages are included in the Anaconda distribution. The
quickest way to check if the package you want is in our module is to
load the anaconda module, start python, and try to import the package
you are interested in. Importing the packages in our Anaconda modules
will also be much faster than importing packages that are installed in
your home directory. This is because the packages in our Anaconda
modules are installed on the local disk of every node, which is faster
to access than packages installed in your home directory.

If the package you are looking to install is not included in Anaconda,
then you can install it in user space in your home directory- this
allows you to install the package for you to use without affecting other
users. We recommend that you use pip to do this, as pip allows you to
only install the additional packages that you need in your home
directory. Conda environments will result in installing all packages in
your home directory, which can slow down the import process quite a bit.

Installing Packages in your Home Directory with pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, load the Anaconda module that you want to use if you haven’t
already:

   ``module load anaconda/2021a``

Here we are loading the 2021a module, the newer modules will have newer
packages. Then, install the package with pip as you normally would, but
with the ``--user`` flag:

   ``pip install --user packageName``

Where ``packageName`` is the name of the package that you are
installing.

If you get an error trying to install a package with pip, first check to
make sure you are on the login node, as the compute nodes don't have
internet access. If you are already on the login node, it is possible
that the installation is filling up the ``/tmp`` directory, you may get
a "Disk quota exceeded" error. You can change the temporary directory
that pip uses to unpackage its packages for installation by setting the
``$TMPDIR`` environment variable. You can create the new temporary
directory, set the environment variable, and install your package like
this:

   ``mkdir /state/partition1/user/$USER   export TMPDIR=/state/partition1/user/$USER   pip install --user --no-cache-dir packageName``

Once you are done it is good practice to delete these temporary files.

Installing Packages with Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, if at all possible we recommend you install packages
in your home directory with pip rather than create a conda environment,
as it'll be much faster. However, if you need to use a conda environment
(usually this is because a package isn't available through pip or to
help manage complex dependencies), you can do so by loading our anaconda
module (this will give you access to the "conda" command) and then
creating an environment the same way you would anywhere else. For
example:

   ``module load anaconda/2021a   conda create -n my_env python=3.8 pkg1 pkg2 pkg3``

In this example I am loading the ``anaconda/2021a`` module, then
creating a conda environment named ``my_env`` with Python 3.8 and
installing packages pkg1, pkg2, pkg3. We have found that conda creates
more robust environments when you include all the packages you need when
you create the environment. Then, whenever you want to activate the
environment, first load the anaconda module, then activate with
``source activate my_env``. Using ``source activate`` instead of
``conda activate`` allows you to use your conda environment at the
command line and in submission scripts without additional steps.

If you would like to use your conda environment in Jupyter, simply
install the "jupyter" package into your environment. Once you have done
that, you should see your conda environment listed in the available
kernels.

**Note:** If you are using a conda environment and would like to install
the package with pip in that environment rather than in the standard
home directory location, you should *not* include the ``--user`` flag.
Further, if you are using a conda environment and want Python to use
packages in your environment first, you can run the following two
command:

   ``export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=True``

This will make sure your conda environment packages will be chosen
before those that may be installed in your home directory. If you are
using Jupyter, you will need to add this line to
the ``.jupyter/llsc_notebook_bashrc`` file. See the section on the
bottom of
the `Jupyter <https://supercloud.mit.edu/jupyter-notebooks>`__ page for
more information.

R Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two different ways we recommend that you use R. First, is
using a preset R environment that comes with the anaconda module, second
would be to create your own R conda environment. This first way works
best if you don’t need to install any additional packages than what we
already have.

To use our R conda environment, log in and load an anaconda module. Then
you can activate the R environment with ``source activate``. You can see
what packages are installed with the ``conda list`` command. Any
packages that start with ``r-`` are R libraries.

   ``module load anaconda/2020a   source activate R   conda list``

Then you can use R as you did before.

If you need to install additional packages, it’s best to do it in a new
conda environment.

First thing to know is that many R packages are available through conda,
and some are not. What you want to do is include as many R libraries
that you’ll need as you can when you create your conda environment- this
helps avoid version conflicts. Conda r libraries are all prefixed with
``r-``, so for example if you need rjava, you’d search for ``r-rjava``.
You can check if conda has a library with the command:
``conda search r-LIBNAME``, where ``LIBNAME`` is the name of the library
you’re looking for. You’ll see a lot of versions, but as long as you see
something you should be good to add it.

Once you have a list of all the libraries available through conda,
create your conda environment (I’m calling the environment myR, feel
free to change that):

   ``conda create -n myR -c conda-forge r-essentials r-LIB1 r-LIB2…``

Where LIB1, LIB2, etc are the additional R libraries you’d like to
include. Sometimes this step takes a while. It’ll tell you which new
packages are going to be installed, and then you can confirm by typing
``y``.

If you have any other libraries that weren’t available through conda,
install them now. First activate your new environment and then start R:

   ``source activate myR   R``

Then you can install your remaining libraries. You can do some test
loads here as well, to make sure the libraries installed properly.

   ``install.packages(“PKGNAME”)   library(PKGNAME)``

In Jupyter, you should see your environment show up as a kernel. For a
batch job, you’ll have to activate the environment either in your
submission script or before you submit the job.
